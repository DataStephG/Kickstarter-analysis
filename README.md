The chart shows that a goal less than 4999 has an increased likelihood of success and increases slightly as the goal descends below 1000. 

What the chart does not show is there is very limited data for ranges 25000 to 29999 through 45000 to 49999, while this isnâ€™t the target of the analysis, if a deeper look into these ranges is necessary, a larger dataset would be necessary for a more accurate representation.
