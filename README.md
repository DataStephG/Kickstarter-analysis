## Performing an outcome analysis based on launch dates and goals.  

The chart shows that a goal less than 4999 has an increased likelihood of success and increases slightly as the goal descends below 1000. 

What the chart does not show is there is very limited data for ranges 25000 to 29999 through 45000 to 49999, while this isnâ€™t the target of the analysis, if a deeper look into these ranges is necessary, a larger dataset would be necessary for a more accurate representation.

Launch date plays an incredibly important role to the success of the campaign with May proving to be the peak season, and declining from there. Also, December is the worst time, with an also 50% chance of failure to meet goals.

Further analysis into the three months that historically perform the best, being May through July, should be considered. Looking into the goals and outcomes within those months might help pinpoint the best time for the amount relative to this campaign.
